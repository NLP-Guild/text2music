# Text-to-Music Generation
This is the Github Repository for the project "Text-to-Music Generation".

- To have some intuition about how this works, check this huggingface space: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Mubert/Text-to-Music
- Currently, we are in a stage where we should check related work and communicate ideas. Later, once we have some creative ideas, we can make plans and start implementation.
- This is an open-source project, so you're welcome to come up with ideas at any time or directly contribute to the GitHub repository.
